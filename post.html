                <p>BTS' Suga is known as one of the quieter members of the K-pop group, but what fans know is that he's an especially wise person with a lot of great and comforting advice. He may not be the loudest voice in the room, but when he does say something, it really stands out.</p>
                <p>Here's just some Suga quotes that make us appreciate him more every day!</p>
                <h2>Encouraging fans to follow their dreams</h2>
                <blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/BTSWeverseTrans/status/1150084928551284736/photo/3" class="b-quote">
                    Thank you for listening to my music. Do not let go of your dreams. You shine brighter than anyone else.

                <h2>Having a simple goal as a person</h2>
                <blockquote class="b-quote">
                    I want to become a good person. But how can you become a good person to everyone? That's my greed. At least I want to be an honest person that doesn't lie. So, I've been trying to live my life like the lyrics that I wrote. Even after 10, 20 years, I can hold my head high to my lyrics.

                    I really want to say that everyone in the world is lonely and everyone is sad, and if we know that everyone is suffering and lonely, I hope we can create an environment where we can ask for help, and say things are hard when they're hard, and say that we miss someone when we miss them.
